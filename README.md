##About
```
ProCaptcha is a plugin that i made for a Minecraft server i use to work on a few years
ago to stop people from botting there server and mass spamming accounts on to there server(s)/hubs.

So what does it do? 
--
Well ProCaptcha Will make people who join the server that is not Oped or have the permisson to bypass it
complete a Captcha (Something like Google Bot thing just in Minecraft).

So how does it work?
--
Well the way ProCaptcha works if the player joins (If not Bypassed ofcourse) it will force open a GUI
they can not close in till clicking the item that is Radnomly placed in the GUI. If they click the wrong
item they will be forced off the server (Kicked) because they will be classed as a bot trying to get on the
server and then ofcourse if they click the right item they will be able to walk around and play the server freelay
