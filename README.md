<h1 align="center">ðŸŽ“ Best Captcha Plugin for your Minecraft Server ðŸŽ“</h1>

```
ProCaptcha is a plugin that I made for a Minecraft server I used to work on for a few years
ago to stop people from botting their servers and mass spamming accounts onto their server(s)/hubs.

So what does it do? 
--
Well ProCaptcha Will make people who join the server that is not Oped or have 
the permission to bypass it completes a Captcha (Something like a Google Bot thing just in Minecraft).

So how does it work?
--
Well the way ProCaptcha works is if the player joins (If not Bypassed of course) 
it will force open a GUI they can not close in till clicking the item that is 
Randomly placed in the GUI. If they click the wrong item they will be forced 
off the server (Kicked) because they will be classed as a bot trying to get on the
server and then of course if they click the right item they will be able to walk 
around and play the server freely.

What are all the features ProCaptcha Offers??
--
1. ðŸ“› - Has a Bypass feature so your staff or player you trust can bypass the Captcha.
2. ðŸ•’ - Will auto-kick people after the Timer (You set in the config) ends if they do not attempt the Captcha.
3. ðŸ§° - Fully customizable so you can change the timers, What Players can do while in the Captcha, and the items in the GUI
4. ðŸ’» - Won't affect your Server performance at all
5. ðŸ’¬ - All Messages are customizable as well
6. ðŸ”’ - Will protect your server from Nasty people/bots.
